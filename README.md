# _
This might become the scripting language written for creating bots on
chessm8.net (when it works). It's called _ because it is a variable
that I have to assign, but won't reference again. Also because I want the rest
of the language to be reasonably verbose.

Also. Please note. I have no idea how to do this.
## Notes
Yes, I know it is in python. I am building it here first because I am most
familiar with that.
## Grammar
See grammar.txt for the planned grammar
## Notable ideas going forward
This language is not designed to do anything unless asked externally. At the
moment, that means that it compiles to a bunch of values and functions that can
be accessed/called in python to return values there. Its aim is to be as safe as
possible to embed.
