# _
This might become the scripting language written for creating bots on
chessm8.net (when it works). It's called _ because it is a variable
that I have to assign, but won't reference again. Also because I want the rest
of the language to be reasonably verbose.
## Notes
Yes, I know it is in python. I am building it here first because I am most
familiar with that.
## Grammar
See grammar.txt for the planned grammar
