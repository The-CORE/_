# _
This might become the scripting language written for creating bots on
chessm8.net (when it works). It's called _ because it is a variable
that I have to assign, but won't reference again. Also because I want the rest
of the language to be reasonably verbose.

Also. Please note. I have no idea how to do this.
## Notes
Yes, I know it is in python. I am building it here first because I am most
familiar with that. In the beginning, this 'language' will be very superficial
in terms of memory and execution, simply storing the values and functions it
assigns in a python dictionary, in a python readable format. This may ultimately
change, but for now, that is all I need.
## Grammar
