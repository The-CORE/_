# _
This might become the scripting language for creating bots on chessm8.net
(when it works). It's called _ because it is a variable that I have to assign,
but won't reference again. Also because I want the rest of the language to be
reasonably verbose.

Also. Please note. I have no idea how to do this.
## Notes
Yes, I know it is in python. I am building it here first because I am most
familiar with that. In the beginning, this 'language' will be very superficial
in terms of memory and execution, simply storing the values and functions it
assigns in a python dictionary, in a python readable format. This may ultimately
change, but for now, that is all I need.
## Documentation
Unfortunately, I have not yet made any extensive documentation. While I do
intend to add this in the future, for now I recommend looking through the tests.
There are some notes here though:
### Grammar
See grammar.ebnf for the EBNF language grammar.
### Language Notes
See name_notes.txt.
