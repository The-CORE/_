Please note that there are several reserved words that cannot be names:
    if
    else
    while
    template
    function
    return
    true
    false
    none
    break
    continue

There are also several read-only names, that cannot be assigned to by
statements:
    float
    integer
    boolean
    string
    container
    set
    get
    delete

Also note that the set() standard method can be used to (and is intended to be
able to) override these restrictions (only within templates though).
