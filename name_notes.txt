Please note that there are reserved words that cannot be a single_name. These
are:
    if
    else
    while
    template
    function
    return
    true
    false
    none
    break
    continue
    float
    integer
    boolean
    string

There are also read-only names, that cannot be assigned to:
    container
    set
    get
    delete

Also note that the set() standard method can be used to (and is intended to be
able to) override these restrictions (only within templates though).
